<h2>Running the project</h2>

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally. These instructions assume you have Python installed on your system.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spayasam-787/MMSETEST
```

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to the cloned project directory:

```bash
cd MMSETEST
``` 

Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Run the Application
Finally, start the application by running:

```bash
python app.py
```
The application should now be running locally. Follow the link from the terminal to access it.
